In our robotics class, here at Willow International School, I've learned to think like 
an engineer. Every problem becomes a puzzle waiting to be solved. 
Whether it's programming a robot to navigate through obstacles or designing its 
movements, every challenge pushes me to think creatively and critically.

It gives me the opportunity to work with my classmates and we learn how to communicate ideas, 
listen to different perspectives, and work together towards a common goal, to make the robots come 
alive we make use of programming tools such as Python and Scratch. 

Technology is advancing at an unprecedented pace, the skills we learn here will 
prepare us to tackle some of the world's most challenging issues. From environmental 
conservation to healthcare, robotics has the potential to revolutionize the way we live 
and interact with the world around us.








It's not just 
about building robots; it's about building relationships and fostering teamwork.
